Hi! Welcome to my programming portfolio.  I want to describe how this portfolio is laid out.
There are two options as a visiter to view my work.

1) You may view my scripts via projects they are included.
	-This can be accessed by viewing the projects folder

2) You may view my scripts via the language the scripts are programmed in.
	-This can be accessed by viewing the languages folder 

Many of these scripts are included in very large projects and not each script will be present for that project.
I only include scripts that I drafted myself, and not those I altered from other users.
I try my best to put enough comments to make the code clear, and they're there mainly for myself so some of them may be odd to spectate.

Not all coding languages I know are expressed in this portfolio.  I've learned many using online tutorials, however the following I've earned certificates
in codecademy.org:

-c#
-Java
-HTML
-CSS
-PHP
~~Ruby (so little)
